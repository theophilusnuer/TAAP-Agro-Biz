            <p className={styles.info}>
                At AgroBiz, we believe in the power of nature. Our journey began when a
                group of passionate farmers and like-minded individuals came together
                with a shared vision: to revolutionize the way people access fresh,
                organic produce and agro products. We wanted to bridge the gap between
                farmers and consumers, creating a seamless platform where quality meets
                convenience and the vast needs of consumers are met without hussle and
                tussle.
